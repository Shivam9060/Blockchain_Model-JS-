# Blockchain Model

## Overview

This is a simple blockchain model implemented using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, Postman, and Redis. This project serves as a basic demonstration of how a blockchain works and how it can be interacted with via a RESTful API.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Redis server installed and running locally or on a remote server.
- Postman for testing the API.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-model.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd blockchain-model
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure Redis:

   Ensure that your Redis server is running and accessible. You may need to modify the Redis connection settings in `config.js` if your setup is different.

5. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. The blockchain model should now be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The project directory is structured as follows:

- `Block.js`: The main application file.
- `blockchain.js`: Contains the blockchain logic.
- `index.js`: Contains the API routes.
- `blockhain.js`: Contains the Blockchain.
- `config.js`: Configuration settings for Redis and other variables.

## API Endpoints

- `GET /blocks`: Get a list of all blocks in the blockchain.
- `POST /mine`: Mine a new block and add it to the blockchain.
- `POST /transactions/new`: Create a new transaction.
- `GET /chain`: Get the full blockchain.
- `GET /nodes/resolve`: Resolve conflicts in the network.

For detailed usage and request/response examples, refer to the API documentation or Postman collection.

## Using Postman

To interact with the blockchain API, you can import the included Postman collection (`blockchain-model.postman_collection.json`) for easy testing and exploration. Make sure the server is running before making requests.
